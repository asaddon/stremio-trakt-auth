# Stremio Trakt Auto Auth

Automatic re-authorization between Stremio and Trakt in a headless environment using Puppeteer.  
This script uses your Trakt credentials and Stremio Trakt UUID to re-establish the Trakt.tv connection if the authentication expires or disconnects.

---

## ‚ùó Root Cause

Stremio does not refresh the Trakt authentication token, which causes it to expire after ~24 hours.  
Some users have reported that the token can expire in just a few minutes.  
An alert may appear in your Stremio web account settings when this happens:
